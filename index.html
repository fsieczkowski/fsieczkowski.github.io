<p>
  I am an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. I
  begun my computer science education at the University of Wrocław,
  working on interderivation of semantics
  with <a href="https://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~dabi">Dariusz Biernacki</a>. I
  then moved to Denmark, first to the ITU Copenhagen, where I obtained
  my PhD, and then to the Aarhus University, where I worked
  with <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~birke">Lars Birkedal</a> and his
  group on separation logic and relational reasoning about programs,
  culminating in (an early version of)
  the <a href="https://iris-project.org">Iris</a>
  framework. Afterwards I moved to Inria Paris, where I worked
  with <a href="https://www.umut-acar.org/">Umut Acar</a> on semantics
  of parallelism, and returned home to Wrocław as an assistant
  professor in the programming languages research group. A few years
  later, I moved to Scotland, where I now remain.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests revolve predominantly around semantics of
  programming languages and modular methods of reasoning about
  programs. These range from separation logic &mdash; I was among the
  recipients of
  the <a href="https://siglog.org/winner-of-the-2023-alonzo-church-award/">2023
  Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and
  Computation</a> for my role in the early development
  of <a href="https://iris-project.org">Iris</a> &mdash; to relational
  models of sophisticated language features (concurrency, effect
  handlers, GADTs) and developments in operational semantics. These
  have inspired my <em>model-driven</em> approach to programming
  language design, where a model of the language and its properties
  influence the design choices for language features &mdash; which
  often leads to improved reasoning principles or stronger safety
  properties. Due to long-term use of interactive theorem provers, I
  am also interested in both practical and foundational issues related
  to formalised mathematics and dependently-typed programming.
